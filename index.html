            <p>Meeting with Towa-sama. That was not a singing video. I met Towa-sama at that concert, the anniversary
                concert of Towa-sama, I heard "Unravel" there, there is no one who wouldn't become a fan after hearing
                that. She is too cool, isn't she? From there, I started watching the singing sessions. Of course, I
                don't check every song. Not at all. But I've seen the ones I'm interested in, and she is cool! I think.
                The feminine part of me just can't help it. It's there, isn't it? I don't buy all the merchandise or
                anything. But I do have tapestries and acrylics stands. I don't call them merchandise, but, well, that's
                it, isn't it? They are like clothes. It is natural to have them. For me, that is. A fan is still a fan
                even if they doesn't buy any merchandise. Merchandise is not everything. Of course, I think it's great
                that people but it. I would appreciate it if my fans buy merchandise. But it doesn't matter, everyone
                has his or her way of guessing. I don't impose "This is how fans should be!". I don't force my fans to
                be this way. You are free to do whatever you want. It doesn't matter at all. It doesn't mean that. I'm
                great because I check all of the distribution. The form of love is different for each person. It's not
                like, "This is the way it should be!". It's not like you have to watch them in real time. I think it's
                weird to impose an idea that you have to watch it in real time. I'm not saying it's bad to watch in real
                time. I'm saying it's not good to force it on people. I... like... I like Towa-sama? Yes, I do.</p>
